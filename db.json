              "Become the master of the multicore domain. Learn how to harness the powers of parallel computation and multicore computation to dominate peer applications in finance software, video games, web applications and market analysis. To yield the most performance, computer programmers have to partition and divide computations to maximize the performance while taking full advantage of multicore processors. Start your path from Padawan to Jedi, after this workshop you will be ready to return to work and have code bend to your will. \r\n\r\nConcurrency, multi-core parallelism, and distributed parallelism are powerful and accessible. These computing concepts promise big impacts on the full spectrum of software applications, including video games, web applications and market analytics suites. Programmers of these products know how to partition computations over large distributed datasets in order to take full advantage of modern hardware and computing environments. These programming skills are not easy to master. This course will introduce technologies and tools available to developers at every level who are interested in achieving high-performance, reliable and maintainable code through functional-style parallelism and concurrency.\r\n\r\nWe are facing a new era of geographically-distributed, highly-available systems with processor designs that are scaling out in core counts quicker than they are scaling up in core speeds. In keeping up with performance expectations as complexities and dataset grow, scaling out software architectures over these modern computing resources is one of the biggest challenges facing developers today. \r\n\r\nThis course will introduce you to technologies and tools available to developers at every level who are interested in achieving exceptional performance in applications. You will gain an insight into the best practices necessary to build concurrent and scalable programs in .NET using the functional paradigm, which covers OnPrem and Cloud based applications.",

In this session we'll introduce you to the capabilities of the compiler platform and demonstrate how we can extend it to more proactively catch common coding smells and patterns that would have otherwise caused runtime exceptions that can be caught during compilation instead. If you've relied on third party commercial coding tools like resharper in the past, you'll see how you can build your own tooling extensions or leverage some of the many open source solutions. ",

Learn how to harness the powers of parallel computation and multicore computation to dominate peer applications in finance software, video games, web applications and market analysis. To yield the most performance, computer programmers have to partition and divide computations to maximize the performance while taking full advantage of multicore processors. Start your path from Padawan to Jedi, after this workshop you will be ready to return to work and have code bend to your will. \r\n\r\nConcurrency, multi-core parallelism, and distributed parallelism are powerful and accessible. These computing concepts promise big impacts on the full spectrum of software applications, including video games, web applications and market analytics suites. Programmers of these products know how to partition computations over large distributed datasets in order to take full advantage of modern hardware and computing environments. These programming skills are not easy to master. This course will introduce technologies and tools available to developers at every level who are interested in achieving high-performance, reliable and maintainable code through functional-style parallelism and concurrency.\r\n\r\nWe are facing a new era of geographically-distributed, highly-available systems with processor designs that are scaling out in core counts quicker than they are scaling up in core speeds. In keeping up with performance expectations as complexities and dataset grow, scaling out software architectures over these modern computing resources is one of the biggest challenges facing developers today. \r\n\r\nThis course will introduce you to technologies and tools available to developers at every level who are interested in achieving exceptional performance in applications. You will gain an insight into the best practices necessary to build concurrent and scalable programs in .NET using the functional paradigm, which covers OnPrem and Cloud based applications.",

Not only can React be used to build progressive web applications (PWAs), but it also can be used to create native iOS/Android applications using React Native. \r\n\r\nBasic concepts of React Native will be covered, such as components, props and state.  Advanced topics will also be covered, such as React Navigation and state management Redux (using middleware.)  The goal of the session is to build an Android app that can connect to an outside API.",

Though it's true that today's world runs on JavaScript, the language was created with form validation and basic DOM manipulation in mind so it leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to writing real-world applications with it. So much so that Douglas Crockford felt the need to write a book entitled, \"JavaScript the Good Parts\" and Anders Hejlsberg, the father of C#, decided to focus his decades of language development expertise into bringing JavaScript into the world of mature, respectable languages by creating TypeScript.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I'll show just what TypeScript is, how it relates to the concepts you already know today, and why you would might consider writing all your web applications in TypeScript rather than plain old JavaScript from now on.",

Moving to a push model allows us to scale easier and react to new data as it becomes available. SignalR facilitates push notifications over HTTP to a variety of clients. The Reactive Extensions were designed to allow for asynchronous LINQ over push based collections. In this talk, you’ll see how the synergy of these two technologies merge to make otherwise difficult tasks, a push over.",

Much of the information in this talk is based on Robert Pirsig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, which, although it is focusing on Motorcycles, applies to all kinds of problem spaces (and Pirsig was a tech writer for IBM). These techniques have served me well over the years. The difference in art versus science approaches is actually supported by the way the brain works.

Neural networks are a very powerful tool that enable machines to teach and evolve themselves. You can utilize this power in almost any application. Don't be intimidated by the equations and Greek symbols of this cutting-edge technology, I will guide you on how to slay this technology and make it bend to your will! In this session, we are going to demystify the presumed complexity of Neural Networks.  No need for a PhD or mathematical background, after this overview, you will be discussing these concepts around the water cooler. There will be very little math and lots of coding. The goal is for everyone to become acquainted with Neural Network from a pragmatic standpoint. \r\nIn this session, we will take a closer look at artificial neural networks inspired by biological neurons. We will study how these neurons can be modeled in a digital counterpart.  After a short introduction of the actor model, the communalities between neurons and how Actors work by building an asynchronous and reactive neural network will be demonstrated.\r\nJust when you think it couldn't get any better, I will show you how to employ the functional paradigm to leverage multicore machines and GPUs to make your neural network predictions infinitely faster through parallelism. \r\nBy the end of this talk, you will learn the basic concepts of Neural Network and how to apply functional concurrency to estimate future stock prices at smoking fast speeds…and perhaps get rich while practicing!",

              "For decades, we’ve been creating ever higher abstractions between ourselves and the computing hardware we’re programming, but in the end whether you’re writing JavaScript, Haskell, or Python it all comes down to 1’s and 0’s running through hardware patterns that were well understood twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nWe’ll walk through the fundamentals of how CPU’s “think” in an accessible way (no engineering degree required!) so you can appreciate the marvel that is the modern CPU be it in a server data center or your fridge at home.  You’ll learn how a CPU turns the code we feed it into actions, what’s the big difference between an ARM and an Intel processor, how CPU’s constantly optimize work for us, and where is it all going for the next few years.\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll show how Meltdown and Spectre take advantage of CPU internals to expose data and why this class of security problems are going to be a challenge to the next generation of CPU's.\r\n",

              "You have an idea for the next great technical book. Maybe you're excited about a new technology that nobody's written about yet. Maybe you're unimpressed with the books that are out there on your favorite topic. Maybe writing a book is on your bucket list. This session will help your idea reach its potential as a published book. Technical publishing is an opaque process with a lot of moving parts, which can be confusing for outsiders to navigate. This session will guide you through the steps you should take to turn an idea into a proposal that a publisher will accept, and what to expect from the publishing experience.\r\n\r\nCreating a great technical book takes more than a good idea. It also requires a knowledge of the market, to determine whether there's an audience willing to buy, or whether the space is too crowded to accept new entries. Publishers vary in their approach and target markets, so you need to determine which one will provide the best chance of success. Self-publishing is an option, but carries its own risks and benefits. Doing the setup work that you may not have thought about yet will help you create a proposal that will appeal to publishers, and will also make the writing process easier.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a contract with a publisher, or have decided to self-publish, it's more than just a matter of putting the words in order. Finding the right environment, setting a schedule, and communicating with your editor are all critical to success. This session will explain how the process works, highlight the parts you may not know, and give you advice on how not to get overwhelmed by your project.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover:\r\n\r\n    The various motivations for writing a tech book\r\n    Traditional vs. self-publishing\r\n    How to craft a quality proposal\r\n    What to expect from the publishing process\r\n    How to make writing easier and more enjoyable",

But somehow, you just can’t get enough of them to say yes.\r\n\r\nIt’s time for a change. Imagine having potential clients call you and demand that you take their money, instead of you calling them and being rejected.

(Ignore them, and you’ll lose a lot of business.)\r\n• Discover the one thing you can do today that’ll make any conversation with a potential client easy. No more feeling like a used-car salesman. \r\n\r\nSo, if you feel like you are treading water when it comes to marketing and growing your business, join this session and get started on your way to becoming a Phenomenal IT Consultant.\r\n",

I can tell you the things that make me regret hiring you.  I can tell you the things that make me happy I hired you.  You'll get straight talk from your manager's perspective.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but obviously I've been that new developer too, and I've learned many lessons the hard way.  Maybe something I say can save you some trouble down the line.",

              "description":
                "You have an idea for the next great technical book. Maybe you're excited about a new technology that nobody's written about yet. Maybe you're unimpressed with the books that are out there on your favorite topic. Maybe writing a book is on your bucket list. This session will help your idea reach its potential as a published book. Technical publishing is an opaque process with a lot of moving parts, which can be confusing for outsiders to navigate. This session will guide you through the steps you should take to turn an idea into a proposal that a publisher will accept, and what to expect from the publishing experience.\r\n\r\nCreating a great technical book takes more than a good idea. It also requires a knowledge of the market, to determine whether there's an audience willing to buy, or whether the space is too crowded to accept new entries. Publishers vary in their approach and target markets, so you need to determine which one will provide the best chance of success. Self-publishing is an option, but carries its own risks and benefits. Doing the setup work that you may not have thought about yet will help you create a proposal that will appeal to publishers, and will also make the writing process easier.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a contract with a publisher, or have decided to self-publish, it's more than just a matter of putting the words in order. Finding the right environment, setting a schedule, and communicating with your editor are all critical to success. This session will explain how the process works, highlight the parts you may not know, and give you advice on how not to get overwhelmed by your project.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover:\r\n\r\n    The various motivations for writing a tech book\r\n    Traditional vs. self-publishing\r\n    How to craft a quality proposal\r\n    What to expect from the publishing process\r\n    How to make writing easier and more enjoyable",

So much so that Douglas Crockford felt the need to write a book entitled, \"JavaScript the Good Parts\" and Anders Hejlsberg, the father of C#, decided to focus his decades of language development expertise into bringing JavaScript into the world of mature, respectable languages by creating TypeScript.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I'll show just what TypeScript is, how it relates to the concepts you already know today, and why you would might consider writing all your web applications in TypeScript rather than plain old JavaScript from now on.",

Neural networks are a very powerful tool that enable machines to teach and evolve themselves. You can utilize this power in almost any application. Don't be intimidated by the equations and Greek symbols of this cutting-edge technology, I will guide you on how to slay this technology and make it bend to your will! In this session, we are going to demystify the presumed complexity of Neural Networks.  No need for a PhD or mathematical background, after this overview, you will be discussing these concepts around the water cooler. There will be very little math and lots of coding. The goal is for everyone to become acquainted with Neural Network from a pragmatic standpoint. \r\nIn this session, we will take a closer look at artificial neural networks inspired by biological neurons. We will study how these neurons can be modeled in a digital counterpart.  After a short introduction of the actor model, the communalities between neurons and how Actors work by building an asynchronous and reactive neural network will be demonstrated.\r\nJust when you think it couldn't get any better, I will show you how to employ the functional paradigm to leverage multicore machines and GPUs to make your neural network predictions infinitely faster through parallelism. \r\nBy the end of this talk, you will learn the basic concepts of Neural Network and how to apply functional concurrency to estimate future stock prices at smoking fast speeds…and perhaps get rich while practicing!",

Moving to a push model allows us to scale easier and react to new data as it becomes available. SignalR facilitates push notifications over HTTP to a variety of clients. The Reactive Extensions were designed to allow for asynchronous LINQ over push based collections. In this talk, you’ll see how the synergy of these two technologies merge to make otherwise difficult tasks, a push over.",

This presentation focuses on innovative problem solving techniques – the tools and techniques to use when your normal process just doesn’t seem to get you to a solution. Much of the information in this talk is based on Robert Pirsig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, which, although it is focusing on Motorcycles, applies to all kinds of problem spaces (and Pirsig was a tech writer for IBM). These techniques have served me well over the years. The difference in art versus science approaches is actually supported by the way the brain works. The talk will cover such areas as:\r\n* Traditional Problem Solving Methods, where they fall down\r\n* Eastern techniques, advantages, disadvantages\r\n* General Tips and how they apply in specific examples\r\n* Brain versus Mind\r\n",

What does the development process look like and can you really use a Linux desktop as your daily development driver?\r\n\r\nMost of us are going to let Visual Studio do the heavy lifting, and that's fine, but in this session, we'll put the IDE aside and work with .NET Core more directly.  We'll install the .NET Core SDK, create some apps with the dotnet CLI and get them running in Linux and on a few Azure services as well.\r\n\r\nThis session is perfect for .NET veterans who are brand new to .NET Core and want to see what the brave new world looks and feels like. It's okay if you're unfamiliar with Linux, but are interested in having options available to you.  And if you're curious what the development experience is like in Visual Studio Code, this session is for you.",

While the GNU version of these tools will be the focus, the skills learned apply to many different platforms. Being available on so many platforms gives you lots of choices. Your choices include Microsoft’s Bash under Windows 10, Cygwin under many Microsoft Windows versions, MAC OSX, the Linux core of Android, commercial Linux — like Red Hat Enterprise, and commercial UNIX — like IBM’s AIX or Sun/Oracle’s Solaris.\r\n\r\nOf particular interest are ‘head’, ‘tail’, ‘wc’, ‘awk’, ‘dd conv’, and shells.\r\n\r\nA few of the differences between UNIX/Linux and Windows will also be discussed to ease your shifts in our heterogeneous environments. This knowledge also comes in handy if you need to migrate code from an existing UNIX/Linux-based application.\r\n\r\n",

But somehow, you just can’t get enough of them to say yes.\r\n\r\nIt’s time for a change. Imagine having potential clients call you and demand that you take their money, instead of you calling them and being rejected. Imagine being able to pick and choose who you want to work with instead of having to take on everyone with a wallet. Imagine being able to increase your prices and spend less time working while still growing your income.\r\n\r\nDiscover how this is possible: Join Sebastian Meine, Ph.D. for this unique session where he will introduce a simple way to attract new clients to your business: The NICER Client Attraction Method™.  \r\n\r\nIn this session, you’ll \r\n• Learn why your current way of finding clients is actually driving them away. \r\n• Experience ways to stop feeling like the best-kept secret in your field and instead be seen as a sought-after authority.\r\n• Identify the five steps every client has to take before they will ever pay you. (Ignore them, and you’ll lose a lot of business.)\r\n• Discover the one thing you can do today that’ll make any conversation with a potential client easy. No more feeling like a used-car salesman. \r\n\r\nSo, if you feel like you are treading water when it comes to marketing and growing your business, join this session and get started on your way to becoming a Phenomenal IT Consultant.\r\n",
